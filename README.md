What are the modifications you made to the game?
Major Modification: 
We added a timer to the game, giving players a time limit of a minute to complete the level. If they fail, the timer does off and they are caught.
Minor Modification: 
We created a freeze function, which causes John Lemon to freeze. In order to unfreeze John without taking up too much time, players must quickly tap the spacebar in order to continue moving through the map.
